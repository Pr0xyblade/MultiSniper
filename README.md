# Features
- Nitro Gift snipe | Listens for nitro gift codes being sent in any servers the user is in, supports discord.gift/, discord.com/gift, discordapp.com/gifts and more to come
- Giveaway snipe | Listens for messages containing 'giveaway' and written by specific authors, which makes custom bots tricky to work with; however, you may submit a ticket in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/aKzQxjy) to add a bot that does giveaways.

# Settings
- alt | Snipe from an alt account (discord token)
- claim-token | When 'alt' is 'true', nitros will be redeemed onto the claim token (discord token)
- giveaway-sniper | Toggle the giveaway sniper (True or False)
- sniper | Toggle the Nitro sniper (True or False)
- delay-enabled | Toggle giveaway reaction adding delay (True or False)
- delay | when delay-enabled is 'true', specify the delay (seconds)

# Features to come
- Maybe a GUI?
- More types of snipers
- Compatibility for more bots
